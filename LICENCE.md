## 1. Attribution Requirement

If the Software or substantial parts thereof are used publicly (e.g. in websites, commercial projects, portfolios, or published works), **visible credit must be given** to the original author.  
This attribution must include the author’s name and a reference to the original repository.

**Example (HTML):**

```html
<div class="credit">
    <p>
        <small>
            <em>
                Page design based on the <a href="https://github.com/David-Voss/Product-Page" title="github.com/David-Voss/Product-Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original layout</a> by <a href="https://github.com/David-Voss" title="github.com/David-Voss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Voß</a>.
            </em>
        </small>
    </p>
</div>
```

<br>
The credit must appear visibly on the publicly accessible page (e.g. footer, imprint, or about section). <br>
<b>A reference solely in the source code is not sufficient to meet this requirement.</b>
